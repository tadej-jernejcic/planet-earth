				<h2>Plastic Pollution in Our Oceans</h2>
				<p>
					Every year, millions of tons of plastic end up in the
					world's oceans, posing a severe threat to marine life and
					ecosystems. From tiny plankton to large whales, plastic
					affects aquatic life at every level, often resulting in
					ingestion, starvation, and entanglement. The persistence of
					plastic waste due to its non-biodegradable nature calls for
					urgent global changes in plastic use and disposal.
